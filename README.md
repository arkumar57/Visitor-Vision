# My Personal Project

For the CPSC 210 term project, I am making a project named **"Visitor Vision"** which will
encompass all the tourist places available to be visited by tourist in a respective city.
The User can view a list of places already part of the project.A user can also add additional places
which he/she would have discovered during their travel.
I believe tourist, as apposed to general residents of the community,
have different intentions to visit a particular place and such a application can surely
help tourist to explore the place to the fullest by following recommendations of other places which can be visited in a particular neighbourhood.

### USER STORIES


As part of the project a user can:
- As a user, I am able to Add a new tourist place of interest in the list of places.
